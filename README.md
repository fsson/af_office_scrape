This project is a web scraper designed to fetch and compile data on all searchable offices listed on the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen) website.

The script automates the data collection process, running daily to retrieve office details, save them as CSV files, and merge them into a single consolidated CSV file for further analysis.
